The pages in the image describe the first part of a cybersecurity training program by ApexPlanet. This part is called “Foundation & Environment Setup” and it mainly teaches beginners how to understand basic cybersecurity concepts and how to set up a hacking lab for practice.

First, it explains the basics of cybersecurity, like what the CIA Triad means (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and the different types of cyberattacks such as phishing, malware, ransomware, SQL injection, and brute force attacks. It also mentions how attackers use methods like social engineering and wireless attacks.

Then it tells you how to set up a lab environment at home using VirtualBox or VMware. You have to install Kali Linux as your attacker machine and install vulnerable systems like Metasploitable2 or DVWA to practice hacking safely. You also need to set up a private network so the systems can communicate.

The next part covers basic Linux commands, how to move around folders, change permissions, install packages, and use basic network commands like ping and traceroute.
